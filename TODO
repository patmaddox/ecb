- Support horizontal scrolling (especially with XEmacs) in the
   intelligent tree-buffer recentering.

- Fix pop-up menus in XEmacs. (JN)

- Ignore source files specified in .cvsignore files. (JN)

- Add history back/forward functions. Should behave similar to web browser
  history, which means we should keep a history list and a current position
  in the history list. (JN)

- Optionally add "(file . line-nr)" to history when clicking on methods in
  the methods buffer. (JN)

- KB: support env vars, like the latest JDE, for settings like the source paths?

- KB: use the JDE source paths if the JDE variable is available 
   (perhaps there are other variables to use by default as well?). We
   should add an option where this external source-paths can be defined.

- Possibility to save the current sizes of the windows. This will make it
  possible to customize the layout better. (JN)

- KB: Easy selecting of a certain ECB-buffer with a ECB-keymap like.
   This means we need an ECB minor mode with
   [C-c C-e ...] as ECB-keybindings:
   d: Directory buffer
   s: Source-Buffer
   m: Method-buffer
   h: History-Buffer
   This minor mode should be enabled in each ecb-buffer and also in
   each buffer in general if ECB is activated.

- KB: the utility- (also know as compile-) window stores not only the
  last compilation-buffer but a list of recent utility-buffers
   (compilation-, help-, etc. buffers) which can the easily cycled
   through by a new ecb-command (maybe also bound to a [C-c C-e ...] key?

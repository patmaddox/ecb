- (BUG) if we are in a compilation buffer, and we do a
  switch-to-buffer-other-window, and the buffer currently in the edit window is
  already the buffer we want to switch to, we should NOT split the window again
  because this would yeild two windows each with the same buffer.

- (BUG) ecb-current-buffer-sync doesn't seem to run from dired.  At least hooks
  aren't run.  The speedbar, eshell and methods buffers all need to be updated.

- KB: Option to auto. expand also "[+] Variables" and "[+] Classname"
   in the methods buffer if 'ecb-highlight-token-with-point' is
   'highlight-scroll. (Like the auto. expand directory feature)

- KB: Support horizontal scrolling (especially with XEmacs) in the
   intelligent tree-buffer recentering.

- Ignore source files specified in .cvsignore files. (JN)

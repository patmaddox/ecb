Readme for the Emacs Code Browser (ECB) v1.70
---------------------------------------------

About
-----

This package contains a code browser for several languages for Emacs. For
instructions on how to use the browser read the online-help (see "Usage" below)
file. The latest version of this package can be found at:

http://home.swipnet.se/mayhem/ecb.html


Requirements
------------

ECB requires the following packages being properly installed:
- Semantic, version 1.4beta11 or higher
  (http://www.ultranet.com/~zappo/semantic.shtml)
- Eieio, version 0.16 or higher (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml).
- If Java code is edited the ECB works best when the JDE package
  (http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde) is installed.

If you use XEmacs you must have the fsf-compat package installed (contains
overlay.el).


Installation
------------

1. Unpack the ECB archive.
2. Add the new directory to your load-path.
3. Add to your .emacs or site-start.el file the line:
   (require 'ecb)

Optional byte-compilation steps:

4. Restart Emacs.
5. Call `ecb-byte-compile'. You can safely ignore all messages.

(You can also bytecompile ECB from the command-line either by using the Makefile
or by using the batch-file make.bat. Just read the comments in that file you
choose.)


Usage
-----

Call "M-x ecb-activate" to activated ECB.
Call "M-x ecb-show-help" to get a detailed online-help for ECB.
If you are using ECB the first time you should read the complete
online help accurately!

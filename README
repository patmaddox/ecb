Readme for the Emacs Code Browser (ECB) v1.80
---------------------------------------------

About
-----

This package contains a code browser for several languages for Emacs. For
instructions on how to use the browser read the online-help (see "Usage" below)
file. The latest version of this package can be found at:

http://home.swipnet.se/mayhem/ecb.html


Requirements
------------

ECB requires the following packages being properly installed:
- Semantic, version 1.4beta11 or higher
  (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/semantic.shtml)
- Eieio, version 0.16 or higher (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml).
- If Java code is edited the ECB works best when the JDE package
  (http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde) is installed.

If you use XEmacs you must have the fsf-compat package installed (contains
overlay.el).


Installation
------------

1. Unpack the ECB archive.

2. Install the required semantic- and eieio-version.

3. Add the new directory to your load-path.

   You MUST add the ECB-install-directory to the 'load-path' either by
   changing the 'load-path' variable directly in your .emacs or
   site-lisp/site-start.el or by working with a file subdirs.el.

   ATTENTION: ECB is NOT properly installed if it's directory is not added to
   'load-path' and for example just loaded by

     (load-file "/path/to/ecb/ecb.el")

   Do not do this!

4. Add to your .emacs or site-start.el file the line:
   (require 'ecb)

Optional steps:

5. Restart Emacs.

6. Call `ecb-byte-compile'. Byte compiles ECB. You can safely ignore all
   messages. (You can also bytecompile ECB from the command-line either by
   using the Makefile or by using the batch-file make.bat. Just read the
   comments in that file you choose.)

7. Install the supplied ecb.info
   The ECB distribution contains a file ecb.info which is the online-help of
   ECB in Info-format. You can install this online help so it's available in
   the Top-directory of Info. There are two ways to do this:
   
   - Use the command "install-info" if available on your system (recommended).

   - Copy the file ecb.info into the info-directory of Emacs and modify the
     file dir manually.

   It doesn't matter if you do not execute this step because the online help
   of ECB is always available though, see 'ecb-show-help'.
   

Usage
-----

Call "M-x ecb-activate" to activated ECB.
Call "M-x ecb-show-help" to get a detailed online-help for ECB.
If you are using ECB the first time you should read the complete
online help accurately!

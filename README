Readme for the Emacs Code Browser (ECB) v1.90
---------------------------------------------

About
-----

This package contains a code browser for several languages for Emacs. For
instructions on how to use the browser read the online-help (see "Usage"
below). The latest version of this package can be found at:

http://home.swipnet.se/mayhem/ecb.html


Requirements
------------

ECB requires the following packages being properly installed:
- Semantic, version 1.4 or higher
  (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/semantic.shtml)
- Eieio, version 0.17 or higher (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml).
- If Java code is edited the ECB works best when the JDE package
  (http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde) is installed.

If you use XEmacs you must have the fsf-compat package installed (contains
overlay.el).


Installation
------------

1. Unpack the ECB archive (probably you have already done this :-)

2. Install the required semantic- and eieio-version.

   *Note*: ECB maybe requires a newer version of these libraries than shipped
   with Emacs or XEmacs. You have to install exactly a version ECB requires
   and also to make sure that the correct version is loaded into (X)Emacs!

   But ECB checks auto. during start-time if the correct versions of semantic
   and eieio are installed and gives you proper feedback.

3. Add the new ECB-directory to your `load-path' variable.

   You *MUST* add the ECB-install-directory to the `load-path' either by
   changing the `load-path' variable directly in your `.emacs' or
   `site-lisp/site-start.el' or by working with a file `subdirs.el'.

   *ATTENTION*: ECB is NOT properly installed if it's directory is not added
   to `load-path' and for example just loaded by

      (load-file "/path/to/ecb/ecb.el")

   Do not do this!

4. Load ECB by adding code to your `.emacs' or `site-lisp/site-start.el'.

   If you want to load the complete ECB at Emacs-loadtime (Advantage: All
   ECB-options available after loading Emacs. Disadvantage: Increasing
   loadtime(1)):

      (require 'ecb)

   If you want to load the ECB first after starting it by `ecb-activate'
   (Advantage: Fast loading(2). Disadvantage: ECB- and semantic-options first
   available after starting ECB):

      (autoload 'ecb-activate "ecb" "Activate ECB" t)
      (autoload 'ecb-byte-compile "ecb" "Byte-compile ECB" t)
      (autoload 'ecb-show-help "ecb-help" "Show the online help of ECB" t)

5. Restart Emacs.

ECB is now ready for use and can be activated by calling `M-x ecb-activate' or
`ecb-minor-mode'. Now you can either starting using ECB or you can do these
optional installation steps:

6. Reading the online help with `ecb-show-help'

   Maybe you are interested to read the online-help of ECB before first start.

7. Calling `ecb-byte-compile'

   This byte compiles ECB. You can safely ignore all messages. (You can also
   bytecompile ECB from the command-line either by using the `Makefile' or by
   using the batch-file `make.bat'. Just read the comments in that file you
   choose.)

8. Installing the supplied `ecb.info'

   The ECB distribution contains a file `ecb.info' which is the online-help of
   ECB in Info-format. You can install this online help so it's available in
   the Top-directory of Info. There are two ways to do this:

    - Use "install-info" (recommended):

      1. Copy the file `ecb.info' into the info-directory of Emacs

      2. Install it with the command "install-info" (if available on your
         system) in the `dir'-file.

      The supplied `Makefile' offers a target `install-help' which does both
      of these steps. You have just to call `make install-help' with the
      correct EMACSINFOPATH set (see the comment in `Makefile'). Here is an
      example:

         make EMACSINFOPATH=/path/to/emacs/info install-help

    - Manual Installation:

      Copy the file `ecb.info' into the info-directory of Emacs and modify
      the file `dir' manually.

   But it doesn't matter if you do not execute this step (8.) because the
   online help of ECB is always available though, see `ecb-show-help'.

   
Usage
-----

Call "M-x ecb-activate" to activated ECB.
Call "M-x ecb-show-help" to get a detailed online-help for ECB.
If you are using ECB the first time you should read the complete
online help accurately!

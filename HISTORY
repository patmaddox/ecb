Version 1.30 (???):
-------------------

- Added menu items for modification of the source paths in the directories
  buffer. (Jesper)

- Added buttons to directories buffer. (Jesper)

- Mouse over files, methods etc. should now work even if follow-mouse isn't
  activated. (Jesper)

- Popup menus should now work in XEmacs. (Jesper)

- You can now specify paths with env-vars like $HOME in the option
  `ecb-source-path'. (Klaus)

- The user must now confirm if he tries to delete the ECB frame. If he wants
  to proceed then ECB will be first deactivated before deleting the frame.
  This works for all ways to delete a frame (shortcut, window-manager-button,
  ...). (Klaus)

- ECB now optionally create its own frame when activated. See the new option
  'ecb-new-ecb-frame'. (Klaus)

- Intelligent recentering of tree-buffers now completely implemented without
  the function 'recenter'. This means no flickering and flashing the whole
  frame anymore after each 'recenter'. Now the ECB display is stable like a
  rock :-) (Klaus)

- Mouse over directories now shows directory path. (Jesper)

- Methods and variables with point are now highlighted. (Jesper)

- ECB windows are now updated when saving new files and deleting files. (Jesper)

- incremental-search in every tree-buffer for easier and faster selecting
  nodes with the keyboard (see new option `ecb-tree-incremental-search' and
  new function 'tree-buffer-incremental-node-search') for more details.
  (Klaus)

- ecb-redraw-layout now restores both edit window buffers and the edit window
  start. (Jesper)

- Spelling corrections. Thanks to Colin Marquardt
  <colin.marquardt@usa.alcatel.com> for spotting them.

- Mode line prefixes can now be set individually for each ECB-buffer. There is
  a default-prefix for each buffer but the user can also define a custom
  prefix or no prefix at all. (Jesper/Klaus)

- Fixed small bug in directory tree that caused directories to be sorted by
  extension. (Jesper)


Version 1.20 (2001-04-28):
--------------------------

- Now the ECB-buffers are intelligent in displaying nodes (Klaus):
  + Expandable nodes: (e.g. a directory with it´s subdirectories). An
    ECB-tree-window now tries always to make visisble as much as possible of
    the subnodes of a node if a node is expanded (e.g. by clicking onto it´s
    expand-symbol).
  + Other nodes: A ECB-tree-window is always best filled, means no empty lines
    if there are enough lines to fill the whole window.

- The source file is only parsed if the ECB methods window is visible
  (Jesper).

- The methods buffer now show fields of EIEIO classes. Only works with
  semantic 1.4. Thanks to Eric M. Ludlam <eric@siege-engine.com> for
  this patch.

- Now all adviced functions behave only special in the ECB-frame. In each other
  frame they behave exactly like the not adviced functions. (Klaus)

- Fix "invalid method-buffer"-bug (Klaus, with a lot of help by Eric Ludlam
  and David Ponce).

- Source files can now be sorted by name, extension or not sorted at all
  (Jesper).

- Now you can precisely define by an exclude and include regexp which files
  should be displayed by ECB. (Jesper).

- Jumping to a method/variable from the ECB-method buffer now sets the mark so
  the user can easily jump back (see `ecb-method-jump-sets-mark'). (Klaus)

- Now you can define a primary and a secondary mouse-button for ECB. See the
  new variable `ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons'.
  Note: The name of the option 'ecb-left-mouse-jump-destination' has been
  changed to `ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination'!

- Now ECB is really ediff-friendly: During ediff is active the advices of ECB
  are temporally deactivated! (Klaus)

- Now all tree-buffers (ECB-buffers) are read-only (Klaus)!

- Better implementation of advising the functions. Now all adviceable
  functions are completely independent from each other (Klaus)!

- Mon Apr 2 21:20:34 2001 (burton@relativity.yi.org): merge my modeline
  additions... this removes the redundant modeline info and shows important
  information.

- Added new option `ecb-advice-window-functions'. Enabling the intelligent
  window functions via customize. No hook hacking necessary anymore!
  Now the intelligent window functions are implemented by advicing (klaus).

- Better online help display (Klaus).

- Added new option 'ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination' (thanks to David Hay
  for suggestion <David.Hay@requisite.com>.

- Adviced 'other-window' acts now exactly like the original but always related
  to 'ecb-other-window-jump-behavior' (klaus)!

- Fixed bug with 'ecb-compile-window-height'. Now ECB has always the correct
  compile-window height after compilation-output (compile, grep etc.)

- New option 'ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge'. Allowing
  Emacs-compilation to enlarge the ECB-compile-window temporally.


Version 1.10 (2001-03-25):
--------------------------

- Automatic expansion of the directory tree.

- Method parsing is now recursive, so that for example inner classes
  in Java are shown in the methods buffer.

- Variables are now shown in the methods buffer.

- Selected files and directories now use the secondary-selection
  face. Thanks to Kevin A. Burton <burton@relativity.yi.org> for this
  patch.

- Fixed some issues with XEmacs. Thanks to Colin Marquardt
  <colin.marquardt@usa.alcatel.com> for this.

- Fixed bug with truncating lines in tree-buffer.el.

- The methods buffer can now be automatically updated when the source
  file is saved.

- Help text is available with "ecb-show-help".

- Moving the mouse over a node shows the name in the
  mini-buffer. Currently this only works when follow-mouse is
  activated.


Version 1.0 (2001-03-17):
-------------------------

- Changed name from JCB to ECB and prefix from "jde-jcb-" to "ecb-".

- Works with semantic 1.3.1 and higher.

- Fixed a couple of bugs when creating and deleting files.

- Grouped customization variables.


Contributed by Klaus Berndl <klaus.berndl@sdm.de>:

- A lot of intelligent ECB window-functions (e.g. ecb-delete-window) which
  gives you the feeling as if the edit-window is the only window of the ECB
  frame.

- New layout functionality.

- The history buffer can optionally be sorted and also cleared.

- The package expanded symbol can optionally be placed before the package name.

- Syntax highlighting of the methods buffer.

- Show argument names and return type in the methods buffer.

- History clear function: ecb-clear-history.

- Added pop-up menu to the history buffer.

- Fixed edit buffer sync bug.



Version 0.04 (2000-11-07):
--------------------------

- Keyboard navigation in JCB buffers. Use Return to select and Tab to expand.

- Tree view of packages.

- Class files can be viewed in the packages buffer.

- Better handling of mouse events.

- Automatic update of the packages buffer.

- Added pop-up menus to the packages and classes buffers. They are activated 
  with mouse button 3 (right button).

- Added method sorting. Thanks to Brian Anderson <brian.anderson@luna.com> 
  for this improvement.


Version 0.03 (2000-07-28):
--------------------------

- Fixed naming of variables.

- Fixed license and copyright comments.

- Fixed class file regular expression bug. 
  Thanks to Jim Loverde <loverde@str.com> for finding it.

- Added three new layouts.

- The JCB buffers can now be (almost) synchronized with the edit window.

- When clicking on a class or method using mouse button 2, it will be loaded
  into another window. A new customization variable was added for this.

- Minor changes. Thanks to Jim for his suggestions.

- Removed the "jde-jcb-window-skips-from-methods-buffer" and 
  "jde-jcb-window-skips-from-history-buffer" customization variables.


Version 0.02 (2000-07-15):
--------------------------

- Changed prefix from "jcb-" to "jde-jcb-". This will cause JCB customization 
  variables to be saved in JDE project files.

- Lists and parses non-Java file types. Currently the C and Lisp parsers from 
  semantic-ex.el are used.

- History buffer implemented.

- Layout function implement. Thanks to Jim Loverde <loverde@str.com> for 
  helping out with this.

- Packages matching a regular expression can be excluded from the packages 
  buffer. Thanks to Mark Gibson <mark@markg.co.uk> for this feature.


Version 0.01 (2000-07-08):
--------------------------

- Initial version.

Version 1.42:
-------------

- Fixed a bug when retrieving parent names for a token. (Jesper)

+ Now the option 'ecb-prefix-key' is customizable so you can define another
  prefix if there are conflicts with other minor-modes or packages (Klaus).

  
Version 1.41:
-------------

- Fixed bug when clicking on token in the methods buffer in XEmacs.


Version 1.40:
-------------

- Tree-incremental-search in the ecb-windows now ignores all non interesting
  stuff:
  + any leading spaces
  + expand/collapse-buttons: [+] resp. [-]
  + protection-signs (+, -, #) in the method-window if uml-notation is used
  + variables types or returntypes in front of variable- or method-names.
  + const specifier for variables
  This makes incremental-searching in a tree-buffer much faster and easier.
  (Klaus)

- ECB now uses Semantic DB to find parents of types. (Jesper)

- Long source paths in the directories buffer are now truncated at the
  beginning. Customizable with variable ecb-truncate-long-names. (Jesper)

- Tokens can now be sorted by access. (Jesper)

- Added a function to semantic-clean-token-hooks that just updates the token
  changed instead of re-building the entire token tree. (Jesper)

- Implemented a token tree cache that stores recently opened buffers' token
  trees. This makes the buffer switching much faster and also saves expanded
  nodes and window positions. The cache is unlimited at the moment. (Jesper)

- Added a speedbar-like layout nr. 11. This is very useful (like also layout
  nr. 10) either for users with small screens or users which normally do not
  need/want the ECB-windows but sometimes browsing/selecting
  methods/variables. (Klaus)

- Better extraction of tokens from current buffer. ECB now displays any token
  type in any order. (Jesper)

- ECB now uses Semantic to display tokens in the methods buffer. (Jesper)

- Much saver ecb-redraw-layout: Now the layout can be restored ALWAYS
  regardless what messy thing has been done before. (Klaus)

- New advice for 'other-window-for-scrolling', so all scroll-functions for the
  "other" window can also scroll the first edit-window if point stays in the
  second one. (Klaus)

- ecb-toggle-ecb-windows now preserves the split, the split-amount, the buffer
  contents, the window starts and current point. (Klaus)

- Some important changes in the ECB-layout concerning displaying compilation-
  and temp-buffers. (Klaus):

  + 'ecb-select-compile-window' has been gone.
  
  + 'ecb-use-dedicated-windows' is not longer a user-customizable option but
    it is always set to t, because this is essential for correct working of
    the ecb-layout engine!

  + 'ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge' is now a boolean option.  

  + Now ECB does all necessary that your edit-window of ECB seems to be a
    normal Emacs frame, especially concerning displaying temp-buffers (like
    help- and completion-buffers) and compilation-buffers.
    
  + The variables 'compilation-window-height' and 'temp-buffer-shrink-to-fit'
    (XEmacs) and 'temp-buffer-resize-mode' (GNU Emacs) are now fully supported
    by ECB if no durable compilation-window is shown.

- New function to toggle visibility of the ECB windows. Now it큦 possible to
  hide all ECB windows without deactivating ECB (see 'ecb-toggle-ecb-windows')
  (Klaus).

- ECB is now a global minor mode with it큦 own menu "ECB" and it큦 own keymap
  with prefix "C-c .". New function to (de)activate/toggle ECB with
  'ecb-minor-mode'. (Klaus)

- Fixed a bug in highlighting current token in the method-buffer when
  font-lock-mode is nil for the source-buffer. (Klaus)

- New option for highlighting the method-header in the edit-window after
  clicking onto the method in the method-window (like Speedbar does). (Klaus)

- Function for automatically submitting a problem report to the ECB mailing
  list: ecb-submit-problem-report. (Klaus)

- Now not only for method-highlighting an idle delay can be set but also for
  synchronizing the ECB windows with current edit window (see option
  ecb-window-sync and ecb-window-sync-delay; default is 0.25 sec delay)
  (Klaus).

- Smarter highlighting of current method (Klaus).

- All tree-buffers now have as default-directory the current selected
  directory in the directory buffer. So you can also open files with find-file
  etc. from within the tree-buffers. (Klaus).


Version 1.32:
-------------

- Nil parent bug fixed. (Jesper)

- New advices for find-file and switch-to-buffer (Klaus).

- Now possible to set an idle delay before the current method is highlighted;
  useful for slow machines but prevents also "jumping backward/forward" during
  scrolling within java-classes if point goes out of method-definition into
  class-definition. Default is an idle time of 0.25 seconds. (Klaus).

Version 1.31:
-------------

- Parents (extends and implements) of the classes in the current buffer is now
  shown in the methods buffer. (Jesper). Possibility to define a regexp which
  parents should not be shown. (Klaus).

- Now displaying the complete node name in minibuffer with the track-mouse
  mechanism works also with mouse-avoidance-mode on; the mouse-avoidance will
  be deactivated as long ECB is activated and the node-name display-mechanism
  is on. This refers only to GNU Emacs! (Klaus)

- Fixed a bug in 'ecb-current-buffer-sync' and 'ecb-redraw-layout' (Klaus)

- Fixed a bug in loading semantic 1.3.3 or semantic 1.4 (Klaus)


Version 1.30:
-------------

- If not all ECB-tree-windows of current layout are visible at redraw-time
  ('ecb-redraw-layout') then the redraw synchronizes the contents of the
  tree-windows with the source displayed in current edit-window (Klaus).

- Added a section "Tips and Tricks" to the ECB online-help. (Klaus)

- Added a new layout Nr. 10 for very small screen resolutions where all
  squarecentimeters are needed for the editing itself. This layout only
  displays a method-window and a edit-window. (Klaus).

- The messages displayed after moving the mouse over a node in a tree-buffer
  do not longer wasting the log, means they will not be logged (Klaus).

- ECB now also works with semantic >= 1.4 (Klaus).

- Now the ecb-compile-window-height is also preserved after displaying
  temp-buffers (e.g. help-buffers after C-h f) - if you want this. See the
  documentation of the option 'ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge'. (Klaus)

- Added menu items for modification of the source paths in the directories
  buffer. (Jesper)

- Added buttons to directories buffer. (Jesper)

- Mouse over files, methods etc. now work even if follow-mouse isn't
  activated (Jesper). ECB adds a more intelligent mouse tracking mechanism, so
  not only the mouse-over-node stuff of ECB works now very well and savely but
  also follow-mouse itself works better and saver as without activated ECB.
  (Klaus)

- Popup menus now work in XEmacs. (Jesper)

- You can now specify paths with env-vars like $HOME in the option
  `ecb-source-path'. (Klaus)

- The user must now confirm if he tries to delete the ECB frame. If he wants
  to proceed then ECB will be first deactivated before deleting the frame.
  This works for all ways to delete a frame (shortcut, window-manager-button,
  ...). (Klaus)

- ECB now optionally create its own frame when activated. See the new option
  'ecb-new-ecb-frame'. (Klaus)

- Intelligent recentering of tree-buffers now completely implemented without
  the function 'recenter'. This means no flickering and flashing the whole
  frame anymore after each 'recenter'. Now the ECB display is stable like a
  rock :-) (Klaus)

- Mouse over directories now shows directory path. (Jesper)

- Methods and variables with point are now highlighted. (Jesper)

- ECB windows are now updated when saving new files and deleting files. (Jesper)

- incremental-search in every tree-buffer for easier and faster selecting
  nodes with the keyboard (see new option `ecb-tree-incremental-search' and
  new function 'tree-buffer-incremental-node-search') for more details.
  (Klaus)

- ecb-redraw-layout now restores both edit window buffers and the edit window
  start. (Jesper)

- Spelling corrections. Thanks to Colin Marquardt
  <colin.marquardt@usa.alcatel.com> for spotting them.

- Mode line prefixes can now be set individually for each ECB-buffer. There is
  a default-prefix for each buffer but the user can also define a custom
  prefix or no prefix at all. (Jesper/Klaus)

- Fixed small bug in directory tree that caused directories to be sorted by
  extension. (Jesper)


Version 1.20 (2001-04-28):
--------------------------

- Now the ECB-buffers are intelligent in displaying nodes (Klaus):
  + Expandable nodes: (e.g. a directory with it큦 subdirectories). An
    ECB-tree-window now tries always to make visisble as much as possible of
    the subnodes of a node if a node is expanded (e.g. by clicking onto it큦
    expand-symbol).
  + Other nodes: A ECB-tree-window is always best filled, means no empty lines
    if there are enough lines to fill the whole window.

- The source file is only parsed if the ECB methods window is visible
  (Jesper).

- The methods buffer now show fields of EIEIO classes. Only works with
  semantic 1.4. Thanks to Eric M. Ludlam <eric@siege-engine.com> for
  this patch.

- Now all adviced functions behave only special in the ECB-frame. In each other
  frame they behave exactly like the not adviced functions. (Klaus)

- Fix "invalid method-buffer"-bug (Klaus, with a lot of help by Eric Ludlam
  and David Ponce).

- Source files can now be sorted by name, extension or not sorted at all
  (Jesper).

- Now you can precisely define by an exclude and include regexp which files
  should be displayed by ECB. (Jesper).

- Jumping to a method/variable from the ECB-method buffer now sets the mark so
  the user can easily jump back (see `ecb-method-jump-sets-mark'). (Klaus)

- Now you can define a primary and a secondary mouse-button for ECB. See the
  new variable `ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons'.
  Note: The name of the option 'ecb-left-mouse-jump-destination' has been
  changed to `ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination'!

- Now ECB is really ediff-friendly: During ediff is active the advices of ECB
  are temporally deactivated! (Klaus)

- Now all tree-buffers (ECB-buffers) are read-only (Klaus)!

- Better implementation of advising the functions. Now all adviceable
  functions are completely independent from each other (Klaus)!

- Mon Apr 2 21:20:34 2001 (burton@relativity.yi.org): merge my modeline
  additions... this removes the redundant modeline info and shows important
  information.

- Added new option `ecb-advice-window-functions'. Enabling the intelligent
  window functions via customize. No hook hacking necessary anymore!
  Now the intelligent window functions are implemented by advicing (klaus).

- Better online help display (Klaus).

- Added new option 'ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination' (thanks to David Hay
  for suggestion <David.Hay@requisite.com>.

- Adviced 'other-window' acts now exactly like the original but always related
  to 'ecb-other-window-jump-behavior' (klaus)!

- Fixed bug with 'ecb-compile-window-height'. Now ECB has always the correct
  compile-window height after compilation-output (compile, grep etc.)

- New option 'ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge'. Allowing
  Emacs-compilation to enlarge the ECB-compile-window temporally.


Version 1.10 (2001-03-25):
--------------------------

- Automatic expansion of the directory tree.

- Method parsing is now recursive, so that for example inner classes
  in Java are shown in the methods buffer.

- Variables are now shown in the methods buffer.

- Selected files and directories now use the secondary-selection
  face. Thanks to Kevin A. Burton <burton@relativity.yi.org> for this
  patch.

- Fixed some issues with XEmacs. Thanks to Colin Marquardt
  <colin.marquardt@usa.alcatel.com> for this.

- Fixed bug with truncating lines in tree-buffer.el.

- The methods buffer can now be automatically updated when the source
  file is saved.

- Help text is available with "ecb-show-help".

- Moving the mouse over a node shows the name in the
  mini-buffer. Currently this only works when follow-mouse is
  activated.


Version 1.0 (2001-03-17):
-------------------------

- Changed name from JCB to ECB and prefix from "jde-jcb-" to "ecb-".

- Works with semantic 1.3.1 and higher.

- Fixed a couple of bugs when creating and deleting files.

- Grouped customization variables.


Contributed by Klaus Berndl <klaus.berndl@sdm.de>:

- A lot of intelligent ECB window-functions (e.g. ecb-delete-window) which
  gives you the feeling as if the edit-window is the only window of the ECB
  frame.

- New layout functionality.

- The history buffer can optionally be sorted and also cleared.

- The package expanded symbol can optionally be placed before the package name.

- Syntax highlighting of the methods buffer.

- Show argument names and return type in the methods buffer.

- History clear function: ecb-clear-history.

- Added pop-up menu to the history buffer.

- Fixed edit buffer sync bug.



Version 0.04 (2000-11-07):
--------------------------

- Keyboard navigation in JCB buffers. Use Return to select and Tab to expand.

- Tree view of packages.

- Class files can be viewed in the packages buffer.

- Better handling of mouse events.

- Automatic update of the packages buffer.

- Added pop-up menus to the packages and classes buffers. They are activated 
  with mouse button 3 (right button).

- Added method sorting. Thanks to Brian Anderson <brian.anderson@luna.com> 
  for this improvement.


Version 0.03 (2000-07-28):
--------------------------

- Fixed naming of variables.

- Fixed license and copyright comments.

- Fixed class file regular expression bug. 
  Thanks to Jim Loverde <loverde@str.com> for finding it.

- Added three new layouts.

- The JCB buffers can now be (almost) synchronized with the edit window.

- When clicking on a class or method using mouse button 2, it will be loaded
  into another window. A new customization variable was added for this.

- Minor changes. Thanks to Jim for his suggestions.

- Removed the "jde-jcb-window-skips-from-methods-buffer" and 
  "jde-jcb-window-skips-from-history-buffer" customization variables.


Version 0.02 (2000-07-15):
--------------------------

- Changed prefix from "jcb-" to "jde-jcb-". This will cause JCB customization 
  variables to be saved in JDE project files.

- Lists and parses non-Java file types. Currently the C and Lisp parsers from 
  semantic-ex.el are used.

- History buffer implemented.

- Layout function implement. Thanks to Jim Loverde <loverde@str.com> for 
  helping out with this.

- Packages matching a regular expression can be excluded from the packages 
  buffer. Thanks to Mark Gibson <mark@markg.co.uk> for this feature.


Version 0.01 (2000-07-08):
--------------------------

- Initial version.

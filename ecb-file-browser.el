This is done during the auto. windows synchronization which happens if a file

adds the path of the new file auto. to `ecb-source-path' at least temporally
for the current Emacs session. This option defines two things:
1. Should only the root-part \(which means for Unix-like systems always '/'
   and for windows-like systems the drive) of the new file be added as
   source-path to `ecb-source-path' or the whole directory-part?
2. Should this path be added for future sessions too?

The value of this option is a cons-cell where the car is a boolean for 1. and
the cdr is a boolean for 2.

A value of not nil for the car \(1.) is reasonably if a user often opens files
not via the ECB-browser which are not located in any of the paths of
`ecb-source-path' because then only one path for each drive \(windows) or the
root-path \(unix) is added to the directory buffer of ECB."

  "*Update an integrated speedbar after selecting a directory.
If not nil then an integrated speedbar will be updated after selecting a
directory in the ECB-directories-buffer so the speedbar displays the contents
of that directory.

Of course this option makes only sense if the integrated speedbar is displayed
in addition to the ECB-directories-buffer.

This option can have the following values:
- t: Always update speedbar.
- nil: Never update speedbar.
- auto: Update when senseful \(see scenarios below)
- <function>: A user-defined function. The function is called after a
  directory is selected, gets the selected directory as argument and has to
  return nil if the the integrated speedbar should NOT be updated.

Two example-scenarios where different values for this option can be senseful:

If `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' is not nil or you have a layout
where an ECB-sources-buffer is visible then you probably want to use the
ECB-directories-buffer \(and/or the ECB-sources-buffer) for directory- and
file-browsing. If you have in addition an integrated speedbar running then you
probably want to use speedbar instead of the ECB-methods-buffer for
source-content-browsing. In this case you probably want the speedbar not be
updated because you do not need speedbar reflecting the current-directory
contents but only the contents of the currently selected source-file and the
integrated speedbar updates itself autom. for the latter one!

If `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' is nil and there is also no
ECB-sources-buffer visible in the current layout then you probably want to use
an integrated speedbar for browsing directory-contents \(i.e. the files) and
file-contents \(instead of the ECB-methods-buffer for example). In this case
you probably want the speedbar updated because you need speedbar reflecting
the current-directory contents so you can select files.

The value 'auto \(see above) takes exactly these two scenarios into account."

This can be useful if `ecb-source-path' contains directories with many files
and subdirs, especially if these directories are mounted net-drives \(\"many\"
means here something > 1000, dependent of the speed of the net-connection and
the machine). For these directories actualizing the sources- and/or directories-
buffer of ECB \(if displayed in current layout!) can slow down dramatically so
a caching increases speed a lot.
 
The value of this option is a list where the each element is a cons-cell and
looks like:
  \(<dir-regexp> . <filenumber threshold>)
<dir-regexp>: Regular expression a directory must match to be cached.
<filenumber threshold>: Number of directory contents must exceed this number.

A directory will only be cached if and only if the directory-name matches
one regexp of this option and its content-number exceeds the related
threshold AND the directory-name does not match and regexp of
`ecb-cache-directory-contents-not'!

The cache entry for a certain directory will be refreshed and actualized only
by using the POWER-click \(see `ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons') in the
directories-buffer of ECB.

Examples:

A value of \(\(\"/usr/home/john_smith/bigdir*\" . 1000)) means the contents of
every subdirectory of the home-directory of John Smith will be cached if the
directory contains more than 1000 entries and its name begins with \"bigdir\".

A value of \(\(\".*\" . 1000)) caches every directory which has more than 1000
entries.

A value of \(\(\".*\" . 0)) caches every directory regardless of the number of
entries.

Please note: If you want your home-dir being cached then you MUST NOT use
\"~\" because ECB tries always to match full path-names!"

to see when a directory will be cached.

This option can be useful when normally all directories with a certain amount
of content \(files and subdirs) should be cached but some special directories
not. This can be achieved by:
- setting `ecb-cache-directory-contents' to \(\".*\" . 500): Caches all
  directories with more then 500 entries
- setting `ecb-cache-directory-contents-not' to a value which matches these
  directories which should not being cached \(e.g. \(\"/usr/home/john_smith\")

contains a lot of subdirectories which contain in turn a lot of entries, then
expanding such a directory or selecting it takes of course more time as

files to display can be specified. If more than one directory-regexp matches
the current selected directory then always the first one \(and its related
file-exclude/include-regexps) is used! If no directory-regexp matches then all
files are displayed for the currently selected directory.

Important note: It is recommended that the *LAST* element of this list should
contain an always matching directory-regexp \(\".*\")!

So the value of this option is a list of cons-cells where the car is a
directory regexp and the cdr is a 2 element list where the first element is a
list of exclude regexps and the second element is a list of include regexps. A
file is displayed in the sources-buffer of ECB iff: The file does not match
any of the exclude regexps OR the file matches at least one of the include
regexps.

But regardless of the value of this option a file F is never displayed in the
sources-buffer if the directory matches `ecb-sources-exclude-cvsignore'
and the directory contains a file .cvsignore which contains F as an entry!

There are three predefined and useful combinations of an exclude and include
regexp:
- All files
- All, but no backup, object, lib or ini-files \(except .emacs and .gnus). This
  means all files except those starting with \".\", \"#\" or ending with
  \"~\", \".elc\", \".obj\", \".o\", \".lib\", \".dll\", \".a\", \".so\".
  (but including .emacs and .gnus)
- Common source file types (.c, .java etc.)
In addition to these predefined values a custom exclude and include
combination can be defined. Here each list must at least contain one regexp -
this can be a least the empty regexp \"\"!

\".*\" matches all files/directories."

   non-selectable menu-separator is displayed.
c) Submenu: A list where the first element is the title of the submenu
   displayed in the main-menu and all other elements are either menu-commands
   \(see a) or separators \(see b) or another submenu \(see c). This allows
   deep nested menu-submenu-structures. Currently a level of 4 is allowed but
   in general there could be an infinite depth of nesting but it makes no
   sense - if possible at all - to define infinite nested defcustom-types. So
   there is a limit of 4 levels but tis is not a hard limit: Just increase the
   value of the `ecb-max-submenu-depth' *BEFORE* first loading ECB!

The function of a menu-command must follow the following guidelines: Such a
function must be defined with the macro `tree-buffer-defpopup-command! This
macro defines a new popup-command whereas the newly defined command gets one
argument NODE. See the docstring of `tree-buffer-defpopup-command' for further
details.

Example for the definition of such a popupmenu-command:

\(tree-buffer-defpopup-command ecb-my-special-dir-popup-function
  \"Prints the name of the directory of the node under point.\"
  \(let \(\(node-data=dir \(tree-node-get-data node)))
     \(message \"Dir under node: %s\" node-data=dir)))

Per default the static user-extensions are added at the beginning of the
built-in menu-entries of `ecb-directories-menu' but the whole menu can be
re-arranged with `ecb-directories-menu-sorter'.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The Emacs code browser (ECB) creates four buffers: *ECB Directories*, *ECB
;; Sources*, *ECB Methods* and *ECB History*. These buffers can be used to
;; navigate through source code with the mouse.
;;
;; To use the Emacs code browser add the ECB files to your load path and add the
;; following line to your .emacs file:
;;
;; (require 'ecb)
;;
;; Optional: You can byte-compile ECB after the ECB-package is loaded with
;; `ecb-byte-compile'.
;;
;; ECB requires version 1.4beta11 or higher of Eric's semantic bovinator
;; (http://www.ultranet.com/~zappo/semantic.shtml).
;; If you are working with Java, ECB works best when the JDE package
;; (http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde) is installed.
;; 
;; ECB is activated by calling:
;;
;; M-x ecb-activate
;;
;; ECB can also be (de)activated/toggled by M-x ecb-minor-mode.
;;
;; After activating ECB you should call `ecb-show-help' to get a detailed
;; description of what ECB offers to you and how to use ECB.
;;
;; The latest version of the ECB is available at
;; http://home.swipnet.se/mayhem/ecb.html

This can be useful if `ecb-source-path' contains directories with many files

means here something > 1000, dependend of the speed of the net-connection and
the machine). For these directories actualizing the sources- and/or directories-
buffer of ECB \(if displayed in current layout!) can slow down dramatically so
a caching increases speed a lot.
 
The value of this option is a list where each element looks like:
  \(<dir-regexp> <filenumber threshold> <cache clearing>
<dir-regexp>: Regular expression a directory must match to be cached.
<filenumber threshold>: Number of directory contents must exceed this number.
<cache clearing>: When the cache should be cleared:
                  + 'demand: Cache will only be cleared on user demand. See
                    `ecb-clear-directory-cache'.

                    regexp after <number> seconds after last caching time will
                    rescan the directory.

A directory will we only be cached if and only if the directory-name matches
one rexexp of this option and it's content-number exceeds the related
threshold.

Example:
A value of \(\"~/bigdir*\" 1000 3600) means the contents of every subdirectory
of the home-directory with name beginning with \"bigdir\" will be cached if
the directory contains more than 1000 entries. One hour after the last
caching time of such a directory the next selection \(clicking onto it in the
directories-window, changing buffers so the directory becomes current in the
directories-window, etc...) will rescan the directory and update the cache.

Attention: Currently the <cache clearing> part is ignored. Currently the cache
can only be cleared on demand and only the whole cache can be cleared, see
`ecb-clear-directory-cache'. This will change in a future version."

  "*Specifies all keybindings for the ECB minor-mode keymap.
The value is a cons-cell where the car is a common-prefix key for all the
keybindings. The cdr is a list of keybindings each of them a list again. A
keybinding has the following form:

  '\(<common-prefix-flag> <keysequence> <function>) where

<common-prefix-flag>: If t then the common-prefixkey defined as car of the
                      value \(see above) is used.
<keysequence>: If the common prefixkey is used then the final keybinding is the
               concatenation of the common-prefixkey \(see above) and this
               keysequence.
<function>: The function to bind to the key. This can also be a
            lambda-expression .

It is highly recommended to use one of the standard keys C-c or C-x as first key
of your common-prefixkey!

You MUST change this option via customize to take effect!

All keysequences must be inserted as a string and must follow the syntax needed
by `read-kbd-macro' or `kbd'. This means you can insert the key in the same
manner \"C-h k\" displays keysequences. Here is the summary of the syntax:

Text is divided into \"words \" separated by whitespace. Except for the words
described below, the characters of each word go directly as characters of the
keysequence. The whitespace that separates words is ignored. Whitespace in the
macro must be written explicitly, as in \"C-c SPC\".

  * The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL represent special
   control characters. The words must be written in uppercase.

  * A word in angle brackets, e.g., <return>, <down>, <left> or <f1>, represents
    a function key. \(Note that in the standard configuration, the function
    key <return> and the control key RET are synonymous.). You can use angle
    brackets on the words RET, SPC, etc., but they are not required there.

  * Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash followed by up
    to six octal digits. This is the only way to represent keys with codes
    above \377.

  * One or more prefixes M- \(meta), C- \(control), S- \(shift), A- \(alt),
    H- \(hyper), and s- \(super) may precede a character or key notation. For
    function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the brackets:
    C-<down> = <C-down>. The prefixes may be written in any order: M-C-x =
    C-M-x.
    Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., C-abc, except that the
    Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and optional minus sign:
    M--123 = M-- M-1 M-2 M-3.

  * The `^' notation for control characters also works:  ^M = C-m."

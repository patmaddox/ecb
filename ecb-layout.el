;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Contains functions for settings the ECB layout.
;;
;; This file is part of the ECB package which can be found at:
;; http://home.swipnet.se/mayhem/ecb.html

;; This file has been re-implemented by Klaus Berndl <klaus.berndl@sdm.de>.
;; What has been done:
;; Completely rewritten the layout mechanism for better customizing, adding
;; new layouts, better redrawing and more straightforward code.
;; 1. Now all user-layouting is done by customizing the new option
;;    `ecb-layout-nr'. The function `ecb-redraw-layout' (formally
;;    known as 'ecb-set-layout) can still be called interactively but
;;    without arguments because it does only a redraw of the layout
;;    specified in `ecb-layout-nr'. All changes to the layout must be made
;;    by customizing this new option. Please read the very detailed comment
;;    of `ecb-layout-nr'!
;; 2. Adding new layouts is now much easier and more straightforward: We
;;    have now a main core-layout function (`ecb-redraw-layout') which is
;;    the "environment" for the specific "layout-index" functions. The core
;;    function does first some layout independent actions, then calls the
;;    layout-index-function for the index which has been set in
;;    `ecb-layout-nr' and after that it does some layout independent
;;    actions again (see the comments in this function).
;;    An index layout function must follow the following guide-lines:
;;    - The name of the function must be
;;      "ecb-layout-function-<integer>". So this function is called for
;;      layouting if a user has set in `ecb-layout-nr' <integer> als
;;      general layout index.
;;    - A layout functon is called without any argument.
;;    - Preconditions a layout-function can assume:
;;      + The current frame contains only one window
;;      + This window is not dedicated
;;    - Postconditions a layout-function must fulfil after finishing the
;;      job:
;;      + All windows of the layout must be created.
;;      + The edit window must not be splitted! (This is done outside a
;;        layout-function)
;;      + The edit window must be stored in `ecb-edit-window'
;;      + The compilation window (if one) must be stored in
;;        `ecb-compile-window'.
;;    - Things a layout function can/should use:
;;      + Height of the compilation window (if any): `ecb-compile-window-height'
;;      + Height of the ECB-windows: `ecb-windows-height'
;;      + Width of the ECB-windows: `ecb-windows-width'
;;    A good recipe to make a new layout-function is to copy an existing
;;    one and modify that one.
;;
;;
;; New adviced intelligent window-functions as replacement for these originals:
;; - `other-window'
;; - `delete-window'
;; - `delete-other-windows'
;; - `split-window-horizontally'
;; - `split-window-vertically'
;; - `switch-to-buffer'
;; - `switch-to-buffer-other-window'
;; - `other-window-for-scrolling'
;; The behavior of the adviced functions is:
;; - All these function behaves exactly like their corresponding original
;;   functons but they always act as if the edit-window(s) of ECB would be the
;;   only window(s) of the ECB-frame. So the edit-window(s) of ECB seems to be
;;   a normal Emacs-frame to the user.
;; - If called in a not edit-window of ECB all these function jumps first to
;;   the (first) edit-window, so you can never destroy the ECB-window layout
;;   unintentionally.
;;
;; IMPORTANT: A note for programing elisp for packages which work during
;; activated ECB (for ECB itself too :-): ECB offers three macros for easy
;; temporally (regardless of the settings in `ecb-advice-window-functions'!)
;; using all original-functions, all adviced functions or only some adviced
;; functions:
;; - `ecb-with-original-functions'
;; - `ecb-with-adviced-functions'
;; - `ecb-with-some-adviced-functions'
;;
;; IMPORTANT: For each new layout with index <index> the programmer must
;; write two functions for this feature:
;; - 'ecb-delete-other-windows-in-editwindow-<index>' and
;; - 'ecb-delete-window-in-editwindow-<index>.
;; Both of these functions must follow the following guide-lines:
;; - Preconditions for these functions:
;;   + the edit window is splitted
;;   + The function gets one argument 'split' which can have the values
;;     'horizontal and 'vertical.
;;   + These functions are always(!) called with deactivated advice
;;     `delete-window' function.
;; - What must they do:
;;   1. Checking if the point is in one of the two parts of the splitted
;;      edit-window. If in another window, do nothing and return nil.
;;   2. Checking in which part of the splitted editwindow the point is.
;;   3. Doing the appropriate action (e.g.
;;      `ecb-delete-window-in-editwindow-0' must delete this half-part
;;      of the splitted edit-window which contains the point, so the other
;;      half-part fills the whole edit-window. If the split has been undone
;;      then non nil must be returned! This action must be done appropriate
;;      for the current ECB-layout with index <index>.
;;   4. These functions can only use `delete-window' of the set of maybe
;;      adviced window functions, because of a bug in advice.el only one
;;      function´s advice can be deactivated within a advice itself!
;; - Postcondition of these functions:
;;   + The edit-window must not be splitted and the point must reside in
;;     the not deleted edit-window.

Beware: If you set a durable compilation window then ECB can not guarantee
always behaving like a standard Emacs concerning displaying temp-buffers and
compilation-buffers. It should work in most cases but maybe not in all. Just
try it out.

- `other-window'

  `ecb-compile-window-height'):
  - `scroll-other-window'
  - `scroll-other-window-down'
  - `beginning-of-buffer-other-window'
  - `end-of-buffer-other-window'
  This advice is per default not enabled.

For working most conveniantly with ECB it is the best to advice all these
functions, because then all the standard shortcuts of these functions are also
usable with ECB without doing anything else. Also other packages can interact
best with ECB if these functions are all adviced. If these adviced functions
are called in another frame than the ECB-frame they behave all exactly like the
not adviced versions!

But please read also the following:

Normally all packages should work correct with ECB and it´s adviced functions
but if there occur problems with a package cause of some of these adviced
functions ECB offers the following fall-back solution:

1. Deactivate in `ecb-advice-window-functions' all the adviced-functions which
   make problems with other packages.
2. For every of the adviceable functions <adv-func> ECB offers a interactively
   function named \"ecb-<adv-func>\" which does exactly the same as the
   adviced version of <adv-func>. Use \"ecb-<adv-func>\" instead the original
   one to get the proper ECB behavior even if the function is not adviced
   anymore.
3. You can bind in `ecb-activate-hook' the standard-shortcut of <adv-func> to
   \"ecb-<adv-func>\" and rebind it in `ecb-deactivate-hook' to <adv-func>.
4. Now you have the best of both worlds: The problematic package works and you
   have the ECB-behavior of <adv-func> as if it would be adviced.

Here is an example: Suppose you must deactivating the advice for
`switch-to-buffer-other-window'. Then you deactivate this function with this
option and you can use `ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window' instead. Bind the
shortcut you normally use for `switch-to-buffer-other-window' to
`ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window' \(use `ecb-activate-hook' for this) and
rebind it to the original function in the `ecb-deactivate-hook'."

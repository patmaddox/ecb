- \[end]: Expand either to a complete node if current search-pattern is
         already unique or expands to the greates common prefix of the nodes
The current search-pattern is shown in the echo area.
After selecting a node with RET the search-pattern is cleared out.

mentioned above!"

  "Creates a new tree buffer with
NAME: Name of the buffer
IS-CLICK-VALID-FN: `tree-buffer-create' rebinds down-mouse-1 and down-mouse-2
                   and also in combination with shift and control to
                   `tree-buffer-select'. IS-CLICK-VALID-FN is called first if
                   a node or an expand-symbol is clicked. This function is
                   called with four arguments:
                   - mouse-button: The clicked mouse-button \(1 = mouse-1, 2 =
                     mouse 2)
                   - shift-pressed: non nil if the SHIFT-key was pressed
                     during mouse-click.
                   - control-pressed: non nil if the CONTROL-key was pressed
                     during mouse-click.
                   - tree-buffer-name: The buffer-name of the tree-buffer
                     where the node has been clicked.
                   The function must return not nil iff exactly this click is
                   accepted. If the function returns nil then really nothing is
                   done by the tree-buffer after this click!
NODE-SELECTED-FN: Function to call if a node has been selected
                  This function is called with the following paramters:
                  - node: The selected node
                  - mouse-button
                  - shift-pressed
                  - control-pressed
                  - tree-buffer-name
                  For the last four arguments see the description above.
NODE-EXPANDED-FN: Function to call if a node is expandable, point stays onto
                  the expand-symbol and node is not already expanded. This
                  function is called with the same arguments as
                  NODE-SELECTED-FN and should add all children nodes to this
                  node \(if possible).
NODE-MOUSE-OVER-FN: Function to call when the mouse is moved over a node.
MENUS: Nil or a list of one or two conses, each cons for a node-type \(0 or 1)
       Example: \(\(0 . menu-for-type-0) \(1 . menu-for-type-1)). The cdr of a
       cons must be a menu.
TR-LINES: Should lines in this tree buffer be truncated \(not nil)
READ-ONLY: Should the treebuffer be read-only \(not nil)
TREE-INDENT: spaces subnodes should be indented.
INCR-SEARCH: Should the incremental search be anabled in the tree-buffer.
             Three choices: 'prefix, 'substring, nil. See
             `tree-buffer-incremental-node-search'.
TYPE-FACER: Nil or a list of one or two conses, each cons for a node-type \(0
            or 1). The cdr of a cons can be:
            - a symbol of a face
            - a symbol of a function which gets to arguments \(see
              `tree-buffer-insert-text'). This function can do anything, but
              normally it should face a tree-buffer node.
            - the symbol t. Then the tree-buffer assumes that the node-text is
              already faces and therefore it does not face the node, means it
              does nothing then inserting the node-text, if the tree-buffer is
              updated.
EXPAND-SYMBOL-BEFORE: If not nil then the expand-symbol \(is displayed before
                      the node-text."

This file contains some important release-notes for ECB 1.32

General:
--------

Please read also the sections "Known conflicts of ECB with other packages" and
"Tips and Tricks" in the online help ('ecb-show-help'). The former one is a
small list of known conflicts and for each conflict a proper and easy
solution!


Installing ECB first time:
--------------------------

No special notes beyond the contents of README.


Upgrading from version 1.20 or higher:
--------------------------------------

No special notes beyond the contents of README.


Upgrading from versions < 1.20:
-------------------------------

+ ECB now requires Semantic 1.3.3. Semantic 1.2.1 is no longer supported!

+ Now mouse-1 and mouse-2 for opening source-files and jumping to
  methods/variables is not longer the default keybinding. Please take a look
  at the new options 'ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons' and
  'ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination'.

+ Now it is no longer necessary to bind in the ECB-hooks (ecb-activate-hook
  and ecb-deactivate-hook) some standard-Emacs-keys for window-handling to the
  ECB replacements for the related standard-functions to get proper
  window-handling within the edit-window(s) of ECB.

  Example: With ECB < 1.20 it was necessary to bind [C-x o] to
  'ecb-other-window' in 'ecb-activate-hook' (and also "unbinding" it back to
  the standard other-window in the 'ecb-deactivate-hook') to get a more
  ECB-suitable other-window behavior. Same for other window-keys.

  This way will work also in ECB 1.20 but it is NOT the recommended way
  because the new option 'ecb-advice-window-functions' makes this much easier
  and better. Please read the documentation of this option exactly!

+ Default-value of `ecb-other-window-jump-behavior' is now 'all.

+ Interactively calling 'ecb-update-methods-buffer' is not longer necessary as
  work-around for the bug, that sometimes the error "Wrong type argument,
  integer-or-marker-p nil" is displayed after clicking onto a method/variable
  in the ECB-method-buffer. This bug is fixed!

+ For a complete list of changes and new features for versions > 1.20 see the
  HISTORY file.
